- We created a content feature that's at the top of the front page.
- Wow, I can see how generating this is easy.
- You can specify the categories you want posts from using `'category__in` in the array.
- You can specify categories you don't want to show too. 
- What we did in the end is simple, we're displaying only categories that we want to see.
- We're displaying one post per category too. Which is what the include is doing for us. 
- This is something to watch and rewatch many times.
