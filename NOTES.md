- how to create a custom page. a unique `about-me` (if you choose `about` as the url in the future, it won't work. you'll have to change the custom page again.)
- Another way to do this is to use the page id. Go to the browser and check the browser box and click and I saw `post=11` for me. So I changed the page to that `page-11` and yeah now I have it. It'll always be linked to that page all the time.
- You can also create a page template, and people can just choose it when creating a new page (better)
